# Inference Configuration
# This file controls the behavior of the inference benchmark script

# Checkpoint selection
checkpoint:
  # Options:
  #   - "auto": Use the latest checkpoint in weights/artifacts/
  #   - checkpoint name: e.g., "run_240" (looks in weights/artifacts/run_240/)
  #   - full path: e.g., "/path/to/checkpoint"
  name: "run_240"

# Episode configuration
episodes:
  num_episodes: 4        # Number of episodes to run
  max_steps: 100          # Maximum steps per episode
  deterministic: true     # If true, use mean action; if false, sample from distribution

# Output configuration
output:
  verbose: true           # Print detailed step-by-step information
  save_results: false     # Save benchmark results to JSON file
  results_dir: "./results"  # Directory to save results (if save_results is true)
  save_gifs: true         # Save GIFs of agent vision for each episode
  gif_save_dir: "./gifs"  # Directory to save GIFs (relative to benchmarks directory)
  save_distance_plots: true  # Save distance plots for each episode
  distance_plot_dir: "./distance_plots"  # Directory to save distance plots (relative to benchmarks directory)
